                    <h2>32 Chunk</h2>
                    <p>Chunk is a large adult male with narrowly-set eyes, a prominent brow ridge,
                    and a distinctive scar across his muzzle. Even at his leanest,
                    Chunk carries substantial fat reserves, especially on his hind quarters.
                    In early summer he tends to shed much of the fur around his shoulders and neck.
                    This gives him a two-toned appearance and exposes numerous scars and wounds.
                    By late summer, his newly grown fur is dark brown. </p>

                        During late summer and fall, she has grizzled, light brown fur and is often one of the 
                        fattest bears to utilize Brooks River. In 2022, she returned to the river with twin 2.5 year-old cubs.</p>

                    <p>Bear 164 is a small adult male. In early summer, he has light brown body fur 
                        with darker brown fur on his lower legs. His fur coat becomes a rich medium-brown 
                        by late summer. Although his ears are blonder than many male bears, 
                        164â€™s most distinctive physical feature is an indentation at the base of his upper muzzle.</p>

                        she is usually very fat with grizzled blond fur. Her appearance at that time somewhat resembles 
                        the shape and color of a lightly toasted marshmallow.
